## General

### Why C Programming is Awesome

C programming is awesome because it offers low-level control over hardware and memory, making it exceptionally efficient for systems programming, embedded systems, and developing high-performance software. It provides a solid foundation for understanding how computers work at a fundamental level.

### Who Invented C

C was invented by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Dennis Ritchie's work on C revolutionized the field of programming and had a profound impact on the development of the Unix operating system.

### Key Figures

- **Dennis Ritchie**: Dennis Ritchie was a computer scientist known for co-inventing the C programming language and making significant contributions to the Unix operating system. His work laid the foundation for modern computing.

- **Brian Kernighan**: Brian Kernighan is another notable computer scientist who co-authored the influential book "The C Programming Language" with Dennis Ritchie. This book introduced C to a wider audience and is often referred to as K&R C (Kernighan and Ritchie C).

- **Linus Torvalds**: Linus Torvalds, while not directly related to the creation of C, is a prominent figure in the open-source community. He is best known for creating the Linux kernel, which is often developed in C and has become a cornerstone of modern computing.

### What Happens When You Type `gcc main.c`

When you type `gcc main.c`, you are invoking the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to compile the C source code file `main.c` into an executable program. The process involves several steps, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. By default, the output file will be named `a.out`, which can be executed in your terminal.

### Entry Point and `main`

In C, the `main` function serves as the entry point of a program. It is the first function that gets executed when you run your C program. The `main` function typically returns an exit status, which is a numerical value indicating the program's termination status (0 usually indicates success, while other values represent errors or specific conditions).

### Printing Text

In C, you can print text using different functions:
- `printf`: This function provides extensive formatting options for displaying text and variables. It is a versatile choice for complex output formatting.
- `puts`: Use this function to print a string followed by a newline character. It's a convenient way to print simple text.
- `putchar`: This function prints a single character to the standard output.

### Getting Type Size

You can determine the size of a specific data type in C using the unary operator `sizeof`. For example, `sizeof(int)` will give you the size (in bytes) of an integer on your system.

### Compiling Using GCC

To compile a C program using GCC, you typically use the following command:

```bash
gcc source.c -o output
```

This command compiles the `source.c` file into an executable program named `output`.

### Default Program Name with GCC

By default, when compiling with GCC, the resulting executable is named `a.out`. You can specify a different output name using the `-o` option, as shown in the previous command.

### Official C Coding Style and Betty-Style

The official C coding style often refers to a set of conventions and guidelines known as "coding standards" or "style guides." These guidelines help maintain code consistency and readability. A popular tool for checking C code against a specific style guide, such as the Linux kernel's coding style, is `betty-style`. It helps ensure your code adheres to the prescribed conventions.

### Finding the Right Header for Standard Library Functions

To find the correct header to include in your C source code when using a standard library function, you can consult the C Standard Library documentation or relevant documentation for your C development environment. The header files provide declarations for functions, constants, and types, allowing your code to use these library features correctly.

### Main Function and Return Value

The `main` function plays a crucial role in influencing the return value of a C program. The value you return from the `main` function determines the program's exit status. By convention, a return value of 0 indicates a successful execution, while non-zero values often indicate specific errors or conditions. The exit status can be useful for scripting and automation, as it allows other programs or scripts to determine whether your C program ran successfully.

Task List
0Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess C File
Objective: Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

Instructions:

Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable $CFILE.
Save the preprocessed output in a file named c.
Hint: You can use the gcc compiler with the -E option to perform preprocessing.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile C File (No Linking)
Objective: Write a script that compiles a C file without linking.

Instructions:

Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable $CFILE.
Generate the output file by replacing the .c extension with .o. Example: If the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o.
Hint: Use the gcc compiler with the -c option to compile without linking.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Assembly Code
Objective: Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.

Instructions:

Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable $CFILE.
Generate the output file by replacing the .c extension with .s. Example: If the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s.
Hint: You can use the gcc compiler with the -S option to generate assembly code.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile and Create Executable
Objective: Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".

Instructions:

Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable $CFILE.
Create the executable named "cisfun".
Hint: Use the gcc compiler without any additional options to compile and link.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Print String
Objective: Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

Instructions:

Use the puts function to print the string.
Ensure the program ends with the value 0.
Hint: You can use the puts function to print a string followed by a newline character.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Print with Proper Grammar
Objective: Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line.

Ensure the program returns 0.
Compile the program without warnings using the -Wall gcc option.
Hint: You can use the printf function with proper formatting to print the desired string.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Print Size of Types
Objective: Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

Instructions:

Your program should produce the same output as the example provided.
Warnings are allowed.
Ensure the program returns 0.
Note: You might need to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on Linux to test the -m32 gcc option.
Hint: You can use the sizeof operator to determine the size of various types in C.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Assembly Code (Intel Syntax)
Objective: Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file.

Instructions:

Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable $CFILE.
Generate the output file by replacing the .c extension with .s. Example: If the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s.
